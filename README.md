## Problem statement
In an increasingly socially-distanced world, society has been forced to resort to virtual means for communication and collaboration. Man is a social animal after all, and cannot be expected to stay productive in the face of isolation. Hence, there is a unique requirement for a platform for like-minded individuals to connect with each other and stay productive. These “virtual rooms” should provide adequate space for collaboration while still respecting personal boundaries and preferences. Publicly visible task lists can go a long way towards improving both collaboration and productivity. Likewise, Music can be used to set the mood of the room and entice new participants. There should be minimal, configurable distraction and users should be able to see and talk to each other if they want. Anonymity should be a first-class citizen and available by default. Like any other online platform, moderation and content control should also be a priority.


## What we done to solve the problem

We make a platform where people can intract with like minded people using groups feature. User can chat with many people in groups in which groups user is intrested.
We also develop a fund rasing feature by which user can receive money from many other user if they are intrested in their idea or problem.
